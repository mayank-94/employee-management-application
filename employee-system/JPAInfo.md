#Hibernate is an ORM(Object Relational mapping) framework. It's primary task is to map Java Objects with
	database tables. It is an implementation of JPA. 


#PersistenceContext : It is a place where all the entities you are working upon are being stored. It basically 
	manages the life-cycle of the entities. It is created at the beginning of a transaction and is destroyed at 
	the end of a transaction.

	
#EntityManager : It manages persistence objects i.e entities It is an interface to PersistenceContext and helps
	us connect to the database.  

	
#A JPA repository is created in this manner - 
	
	@Repository
	public interface BookRepository extends JpaRepository<Book, Integer>{
	}
	
	
#JPA Repositories methods used in CRUD Operations : 

	- repo.findById()
	- repo.findAll()
	- repo.deleteById()
	- repo.save()
	
	
#Custom Method for searching and deleting by specific attribute - 
  
   @Repository
   public interface BookRepository extends JpaRepository<Book, Integer>{
   		List<Book> findByAuthor(String author);
   }
   
  findBy or queryBy, can be used to search by any other attribute defined in Entity, provided there should be a 
  field in Entity whose name should exactly matches with anything comes after findBy or queryBy or even deleteBy -
  Here, Book should have an attribute named "author"

	
#Basic JPA annotations:
 - @Entity : It marks the class as a JPA entity, i.e it will be managed by EntityManager.
 - @Id : It marks the primary key of the table.
 - @GeneratedValue : It means hibernate will create the value of that attribute, usually Primary key is marked with this.
 - @Table : It maps the table name of database with the entity name.
 - @Column : It maps the column name of the table with the name of the field of an entity.
 
 
#Few Properties:
 - spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update (will create the table automatically with the mapped Entity if doesn't exist)
 - spring.jpa.show-sql=true (will show the sql fired for a particular method by JPA)
 - spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect (For setting the SQL Dialect you are using)
 - spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true (Not advised to use in production) 

	
#JpaRepository extends PagingAndSortingRepository and it extends CrudRepository. CrudRepository provides
	simple CRUD operations, PagingAndSortingRepository provides paging and sorting methods.
	
	Sort sort = Sort.By(Sort.DIRECTION.ASC, "empName");
	List<Employee> employees = repo.findAll(sort);
	
	PageRequest pageable = PageRequest.of(pgNum, pgSize, <sort>)
	Page<Employee> page = repo.findAll(pageable);
	return page.getContent();


#Relationships between entities - 
 - @OneToOne : Employee to Pan
 - @OneToMany : Company To Employee
 - @ManyToOne : Employee To Company
 - @ManyToMany : Course To Reviews	


#Embeddable vs Embedded - 
	Sometimes you do not want to create any relationships between entities. You simply want to embed an 
	object into another.
	
		@Embeddable
		public class Address{
		}
		Address -> city, state
		
		@Entity
		public class Employee{
			@Embedded
			private Address address;
		} 
		Employee -> id, name, city, state


#Inheritance in JPA:
 - SINGLE_TABLE : A single table is created for all the sub-classes and parent class and an additional column
 	get added i.e D_TYPE, that represents that sub-class entity. It can be customized using the annotation @DiscriminatorColumn.
 	
	 	@Entity
	 	@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)
	 	@DiscriminatorColumn(name="Employee_Type"
	 	public class Employee{
	 	}

 - TABLE_PER_CLASS : Each sub-class will have it's own table and no table will be created for the parent class.
 	
 		@Entity
 		@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
 		public class Employee{
 		}
 		
 - JOINED : A separate table is created for that fields that are specific to the sub-class than the fields that are common
 	to the parent class and a joined is performed between parent class and super class.
 	
 		@Entity
 		@Inheritance(strategy = InheitanceType.JOINED)
 		public class Employee{
 		}
 		
 - MappedSuperClass : In this type we don't use Inheritance, A separate table is created for each sub-class and no
 	table will be created for the parent class. The parent class can't be an Entity
 	
 		@MappedSuperClass
 		public class Employee{
 		} 	  


#Problems occurred during concurrent transactions - 
 - Dirty Read: It occurs when one transaction reads data that is being modified by another transaction and has
 	not been committed by the first transaction.
 	
 - Non Repeatable Read: When a transaction reads same data more than once and each time it gets a different value.
 
 - Phanthom Read: When two same queries are executed and the number of rows retrieved are different,
 	either new rows are inserted or some rows are deleted. 
 	
 	
#Isolation levels to solve the above problems - 
 - Read Uncommitted: It is lowest level of isolation, using this any transaction can read data even if it is
 	being modified.
 	
 - Read Committed: Using this isolation level a transaction can only read the data if it committed by another
 	transaction. A lock is performed by the transaction that is modifying the data.
 	
 - Repeatable Read: Using this isolation a lock is performed not only on the modified value but also on the data
 	that has been read during the transaction. If a transaction has read 1 row during the transaction then the
	entire row is locked.
	
 - Serializable: This is the highest level of isolation. It locks all the rows that are fetched during a transaction
 	satisfying a certain criteria. e.g - Select * from persons, now the entire table will be locked. No new row can 
 	either be deleted or inserted.
 	
 		spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.connection.isolation=2
 		1 = Read Uncommitted
 		2 = Read Committed
 		4 = Repeatable Read
 		8 = Serializable
		Note - Read Committed is preferred one, Serializable gives worst performance.
